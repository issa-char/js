# Module 4: JavaScript Frameworks and Tools

This module covers some of the most popular and widely used JavaScript frameworks and tools, such as React, Angular, Vue, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase. You will learn how to use these frameworks and tools to create dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications. You will also learn how to use some of the best practices and conventions for writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.

## Projects

The projects in this module are designed to help you demonstrate your skills
and creativity in JavaScript frameworks
and tools.
Each project consists of a description of the requirements
and a code editor where you can write your code.
You can run your code
and see your results using the browser or a live server.

The projects in this module are:

- **Project 1: Todo List**: In this project
