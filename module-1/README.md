# Module 1: JavaScript Basics

This module covers the syntax, data types, operators, control structures, functions, and objects of JavaScript. You will learn how to declare variables, write expressions, use conditional statements, loops, arrays, and more. You will also learn how to create and use functions and objects, as well as how to work with the built-in objects of JavaScript.

## Lessons

The lessons in this module are:

- **Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript**: This lesson introduces you to the history, features, and uses of JavaScript. You will learn what JavaScript is, how it works, and where it runs. You will also learn how to write and run your first JavaScript program using the browser console or a code editor.
- **Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types**: This lesson teaches you how to declare and assign variables in JavaScript. You will learn about the different data types in JavaScript, such as numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, and symbols. You will also learn how to use operators to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations on values.
- **Lesson 3: Control Structures**: This lesson teaches you how to use control structures in JavaScript to control the flow of your program. You will learn how to use conditional statements, such as if-else and switch-case, to execute different blocks of code based on conditions. You will also learn how to use loops, such as for, while, and do-while, to repeat a block of code multiple times.
- **Lesson 4: Arrays**: This lesson teaches you how to use arrays in JavaScript to store and manipulate multiple values. You will learn how to create and access arrays using literals and constructors. You will also learn how to use array methods and properties to add, remove, modify, search, sort, and iterate over array elements.
- **Lesson 5: Functions**: This lesson teaches you how to use functions in JavaScript to define and execute reusable blocks of code. You will learn how to create and invoke functions using declarations and expressions. You will also learn how to use parameters and arguments to pass values to and from functions. You will also learn about the scope and context of functions, as well as the return statement.
- **Lesson 6: Objects**: This lesson teaches you how to use objects in JavaScript to store and manipulate key-value pairs. You will learn how to create and access objects using literals and constructors. You will also learn how to use object methods and properties to add, remove, modify, search, and iterate over object properties. You will also learn about the prototype chain and inheritance in JavaScript.


## Projects

The projects in this module are designed to help you demonstrate your skills and creativity in JavaScript. Each project consists of a description of the requirements and a code editor where you can write your code. You can run your code and see your results using the browser or a live server.

The projects in this module are:

- **Project 1: Calculator**: In this project, you will create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. You will use variables, data types, operators, functions, and events in JavaScript.
- **Project 2: Quiz App**: In this project, you will create a quiz app that can ask multiple-choice questions on any topic. You will use arrays, control structures, functions, objects, and events in JavaScript.
- **Project 3: Todo List**: In this project, you will create a todo list that can add, delete, mark as done, and filter tasks. You will use arrays, objects, functions, events, local storage, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
