# Module 2: JavaScript in the Browser

This module covers the Document Object Model (DOM), events, forms, and Ajax in JavaScript. You will learn how to manipulate the HTML elements and styles using JavaScript, how to handle user interactions with events and event listeners, how to validate and submit forms using JavaScript, and how to make asynchronous requests to servers using Ajax.

## Lessons

The lessons in this module are:

- **Lesson 1: The Document Object Model (DOM)**: This lesson introduces you to the DOM, which is a representation of the HTML document as a tree of nodes. You will learn how to access and modify the DOM using JavaScript, such as selecting, creating, appending, removing, and updating elements and attributes. You will also learn how to use the DOM methods and properties to get and set the text content, inner HTML, and style of elements.
- **Lesson 2: Events**: This lesson teaches you how to use events in JavaScript to respond to user actions or changes in the state of the document. You will learn about the different types of events, such as mouse, keyboard, form, window, and custom events. You will also learn how to register and remove event listeners using the addEventListener and removeEventListener methods. You will also learn how to use the event object to access information about the event, such as the target, type, coordinates, key code, etc. 
- **Lesson 3: Forms**: This lesson teaches you how to use forms in JavaScript to collect user input and submit data to servers. You will learn how to access and manipulate form elements using JavaScript, such as getting and setting the value, checked, selected, disabled, and required properties. You will also learn how to validate form data using JavaScript, such as checking for empty fields, matching patterns, comparing values, etc. You will also learn how to prevent the default behavior of form submission and use Ajax instead.
- **Lesson 4: Ajax**: This lesson teaches you how to use Ajax in JavaScript to make asynchronous requests to servers without reloading the page. You will learn how to use the XMLHttpRequest object to create and send requests, as well as handle the response. You will also learn how to use the fetch API to make requests using promises and async/await. You will also learn how to use JSON as a data format for exchanging data between clients and servers.

## Projects

The projects in this module are designed to help you demonstrate your skills and creativity in JavaScript in the browser. Each project consists of a description of the requirements and a code editor where you can write your code. You can run your code and see your results using the browser or a live server.

The projects in this module are:

- **Project 1: Clock**: In this project, you will create a digital clock that displays the current date and time using JavaScript. You will use the DOM methods and properties to create and update the clock elements. You will also use the Date object and the setInterval function to get and update the date and time every second.
- **Project 2: Calculator**: In this project, you will create a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers using JavaScript. You will use the DOM methods and properties to create and access the calculator elements. You will also use events and event listeners to handle user clicks on the buttons. You will also use functions and operators to perform calculations on the input values.
- **Project 3: Todo List**: In this project, you will create a todo list that can add, delete, mark as done, and filter tasks using JavaScript. You will use the DOM methods and properties to create and access the todo list elements. You will also use events and event listeners to handle user actions on the tasks. You will also use arrays and local storage to store and retrieve the tasks.
- **Project 4: Weather App**: In this project, you will create a weather app that can display the current weather information for any city using JavaScript. You will use Ajax and fetch API to make requests to a weather API that provides weather data in JSON format. You will also use DOM methods and properties to display the weather data on the page.
