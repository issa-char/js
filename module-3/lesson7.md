# Lesson 7: Classes

## Introduction

Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and JavaScript introduced classes in ES6 to provide a more straightforward way to create objects and deal with inheritance. This lesson provides an exhaustive overview of classes, including their creation, usage, and various features like constructors, `this` keyword, `super` keyword, getters and setters, static methods and properties, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Understanding Classes

In JavaScript, a class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword `function` to initiate it, we use the keyword `class`, and the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

## Creating and Using Classes

A class is defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces `{}`. All of the properties and methods go inside the curly braces:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
}
```

The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. It can take any number of parameters.

## The `this` and `super` Keywords

The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access properties of the class.

The `super` keyword is used to call corresponding methods of the parent class. This is particularly useful in the case of inheritance.

## Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are used to protect the data, particularly when creating an API. They are defined using `get` and `set` keywords.

## Static Methods and Properties

Static methods and properties are defined on the class itself, not on the instances of the class.

## Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction

Inheritance is a mechanism of acquiring the features and behaviors of a class by another class. The `extends` keyword is used to create a child class of another class.

Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In JavaScript, polymorphism is achieved through function overloading and overriding.

Abstraction is a mechanism that allows us to represent the essential features without including background details. It's achieved in JavaScript using interfaces and abstract classes.

## Conclusion

By the end of this lesson, you will have a comprehensive understanding of classes in JavaScript. You will know what classes are, how they work, how to create and use them, and how to use various features of classes like constructors, `this` keyword, `super` keyword, getters and setters, static methods and properties, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. This knowledge will be invaluable in your journey as a JavaScript developer.
