# Module 3: JavaScript Beyond the Basics

This module covers the advanced topics of JavaScript, such as closures, higher-order functions, promises, async/await, generators, modules, and classes. You will learn how to use these features to write more concise, elegant, and maintainable JavaScript code. You will also learn how to use modern JavaScript syntax and tools, such as ES6+, Babel, and Webpack.

## Lessons

The lessons in this module are:

- **Lesson 1: Closures**: This lesson teaches you what closures are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use closures to access variables from outer scopes, preserve state, and implement private data and methods. You will also learn about the benefits and drawbacks of closures, as well as some common use cases and patterns.
- **Lesson 2: Higher-Order Functions**: This lesson teaches you what higher-order functions are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return other functions as results. You will also learn how to use some built-in higher-order functions, such as map, filter, reduce, forEach, and sort. You will also learn how to use arrow functions to write shorter and more concise function expressions.
- **Lesson 3: Promises**: This lesson teaches you what promises are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way. You will also learn how to use the then, catch, and finally methods to chain promises and handle success, failure, and completion of asynchronous operations. You will also learn how to use the Promise.all and Promise.race methods to combine multiple promises into one.
- **Lesson 4: Async/Await**: This lesson teaches you what async/await are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to use the async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. You will also learn how to use try-catch blocks to handle errors in async/await code. You will also learn how to use async/await with promises, fetch API, and generators.
- **Lesson 5: Generators**: This lesson teaches you what generators are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use generators to produce values on demand using the yield keyword. You will also learn how to use the next, return, and throw methods to control the execution of generators. You will also learn how to use generators with iterators, for-of loops, and async/await.
- **Lesson 6: Modules**: This lesson teaches you what modules are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use modules to organize your code into separate files that can be imported and exported using the import and export keywords. You will also learn how to use default and named exports, as well as dynamic imports. You will also learn how to use Babel and Webpack to transpile and bundle your modules for browser compatibility.
- **Lesson 7: Classes**: This lesson teaches you what classes are and how they work in JavaScript. You will learn how to create and use classes to define custom data types with properties and methods using the class keyword. You will also learn how to use the constructor method, the this keyword, the super keyword, getters and setters, static methods and properties, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction with classes.


## Projects

The projects in this module are designed to help you demonstrate your skills and creativity in JavaScript beyond the basics. Each project consists of a description of the requirements and a code editor where you can write your code. You can run your code and see your results using the browser or a live server.

The projects in this module are:

- **Project 1: Counter**: In this project, you will create a counter that can increment, decrement, reset, or set a custom value using closures. You will use a closure function that returns an object with four methods: increment, decrement, reset, and set. You will also use a variable in the closure scope that stores the current value of the counter.
- **Project 2: Calculator**: In this project, you will create a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers using higher-order functions. You will use higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return other functions as results. You will also use arrow functions to write shorter function expressions.
- **Project 3: Weather App**: In this project
